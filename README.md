# Backgammon

Welcome to my java rendition of the classic game, Backgammon!

This game was built using Java swing, and so all interactions are on a user friendly interface.

Simply start the game by running the master file and then selecting multiplayer in the menu.
From there, select your pieces to move them based on your die rolls.
